      <p><strong>About this Kata</strong></p>

<p>This kata is blatantly stolen from acm.uva.es/p/v103/10315.html It is a
subset of <a href="https://codingdojo.org/kata/TexasHoldEm">KataTexasHoldEm</a> , which is a very large
Kata.</p>

<p><strong>Problem Description</strong></p>

<p>Your job is to compare several pairs of poker hands and to indicate
which, if either, has a higher rank.</p>

<p><strong>Poker rules description</strong></p>

<p>A poker deck contains 52 cards - each card has a suit which is one of
clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades (denoted C, D, H, and S in the input
data). Each card also has a value which is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace (denoted 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q,
K, A). For scoring purposes, the suits are unordered while the values
are ordered as given above, with 2 being the lowest and ace the highest
value.</p>

<p>A poker hand consists of 5 cards dealt from the deck. Poker hands are
ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest.</p>

<ul>
<li>High Card: Hands which do not fit any higher category are ranked by
the value of their highest card. If the highest cards have the same
value, the hands are ranked by the next highest, and so on.</li>
<li>Pair: 2 of the 5 cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which
both contain a pair are ranked by the value of the cards forming
the pair. If these values are the same, the hands are ranked by the
values of the cards not forming the pair, in decreasing order.</li>
<li>Two Pairs: The hand contains 2 different pairs. Hands which both
contain 2 pairs are ranked by the value of their highest pair. Hands
with the same highest pair are ranked by the value of their
other pair. If these values are the same the hands are ranked by the
value of the remaining card.</li>
<li>Three of a Kind: Three of the cards in the hand have the same value.
Hands which both contain three of a kind are ranked by the value of
the 3 cards.</li>
<li>Straight: Hand contains 5 cards with consecutive values. Hands which
both contain a straight are ranked by their highest card.</li>
<li>Flush: Hand contains 5 cards of the same suit. Hands which are both
flushes are ranked using the rules for High Card.</li>
<li>Full House: 3 cards of the same value, with the remaining 2 cards
forming a pair. Ranked by the value of the 3 cards.</li>
<li>Four of a kind: 4 cards with the same value. Ranked by the value of
the 4 cards.</li>
<li>Straight flush: 5 cards of the same suit with consecutive values.
Ranked by the highest card in the hand.</li>
</ul>
